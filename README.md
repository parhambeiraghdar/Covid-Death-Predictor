# Covid-Death-Predictor
This project is a logistic regression model built from scratch to predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients based on their clinical data. The model is implemented in Python using only NumPy and Pandas, without the use of high-level machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn for the core modeling part.
